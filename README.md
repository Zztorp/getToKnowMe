# getToKnowMe
My first portfolio

This is my very first school project where I wanted to learn more about flexbox 
and understand how I can use classes in the best way to style the different divs and so on.

It feels so awesome to code more creatively and not just be behind the scenes as a backend developer. 
Exciting to get an insight into both worlds you know!

Got inspiration from various YT videos and various step by step websites.

This project has been really fun and creative and I have learned a lot and *BONUS* you will learn a lot about me ;D .

Peace out!
